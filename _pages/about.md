I'm now an undergraduate student from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). I major in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics (Qiushi Mathematical Science Program). I am still trying to figure out what I'm interested in. Up to now, I want to learn more about PDE.

Now, I participate in a SRTP(Student Research Training Program) advised by [Prof.Wang Wei](https://person.zju.edu.cn/wangw07). We are interested in the solution of Landau-de Gennes model in liquid crystal.
